for graph question first start solving with basic idea and flow
optimized along with code and add whatever it required in flow 

e.g. visited array  (an array(if data structure of node is integer) or unordered set (set if data structer of node is bigger and complex e.g. string))


//inorder to reduce for loop in bfs in graph we add it in queue as pair of node and level

//also if want to break loop but we are in deeeply nested loop try to come up breaking loop at starting of queue pop



ASCII characher



//convert a string to lower case
transform(arr.begin(),arr.end(),arr.end(),::tolower())
