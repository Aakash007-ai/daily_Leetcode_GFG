Data Structure :-
It is a way of storing data in RAM
RAM is Read only memory
It store data. It has 2 sections Data and its address
    Data    | | | | | | | |
    Address | | | | | | | |

RAM we generally says 4GB RAM
4 * 10e9 Bytes
where 1 Bytes means 4 bits
and a integer takes 4 bytes of data 
a char takes 1Bytes of data

Array
static array
when we says an array, it means continguous allocation of data
so there are static array and dynamic array
writing , editing in static array O(1)
dynamic array
insertion time O(1) (by power exponention maths)
