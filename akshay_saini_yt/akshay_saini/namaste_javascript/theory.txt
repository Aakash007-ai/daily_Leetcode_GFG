everything happen in javascript inside an execution context

execution context is like big box having 2 components

first component Memory componnet called variable environment where all variable and functions are stored as key value pair

second component is called code component called thread of execution where whole code is executed line by line 


JAvascript is a synchronous single-threaded language


when we say single thread it means it execute only single line at one time  and sychronous meas it excute one line after another




WHat happens whn we run a javascript program 
a execution context gets created 
check callstack.js



*****parameter of the function and argument of function call



hoisting in javascript
access variable before we have initialized that 
(as it is in memory context part)

even before start executing code  memory get allocated to them 

so var get defined as undefined
and a simple function get copied line by line

**arrow function are treated as normally like a varaible , it will give us undeifned

it store as undefiend during runtime of execution context







how function work in js






shortest js program 

we want to display a variable e.g. 
console.log(x);

it will try to find it in global context
