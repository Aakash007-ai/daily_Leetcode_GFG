problem statememtn given an array and a number
arr 2 3 5 2 9 7 1
k = 3 size of subarray

subarray contiguous part of array
so find maximum of subarray sum of size k

brute force
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
    for(int j=0;j<k;k++){
        find sum upto k
    }
    max 
}

so , optimizing this 
check for repeted work 
we are doing sum again of same int 

so one way is doing prefix sum but it takes o(n) space extra
another way 
start traversing over array until window is made
once window is made we compare it with ans and move 1 window forward by deleting first element and adding next window element of array


identification 
array/string ask for subarray/substring with largest sum and a window size

for varaible window size we are asking for window size
so , we traverse until we are moving toward condition and break as condition start fails in same way deleting first elements of window and adding next elements

e.g we are given a sum find window of max length
arr 3 2 4 5 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 3

so 2 pointer i and j
while(j<arr.size()){
    if(wsum > sum){
        delete last and add new
    }else if( wsum<sum){
        increase window size
    }

    //check if condition met
    
    
}
