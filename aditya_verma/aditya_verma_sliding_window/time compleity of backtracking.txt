time compleity of backtracking 


ork done at an individual node * no. of node in tree

for a complete binary tree 

at firt level 1 node then  node then 4 noed then 8
^0 + ^1 + ^ + ^3 upto height h = 2^h

and if iterate over a string of size h in a string at each level we decrement h by 1
so tc O(n)*2^n;


//for permutation of string question
n + n*n-1 + n*n-1*n-2 + n*n-1*.....*1
we have total no. of nodes as n!
and internal we traverse over length of string 
and for getting substring we have o(n^2)
so total time complexity is o(n^2 * n!)
