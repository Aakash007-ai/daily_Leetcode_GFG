asked in flipkart interview  with great base 16 ctc 20

given k and smallest/largest 

which heap to choose

k+smallest -> max heap 
k+largest -> min heap 


kth largest element  -> we put element and remove k elements from heap


k are sorting questions,

we can do by sorting nlogn

but using heap of size k time complexity becom nlogk


problem :-----find kth largest element 
we iterate over array and going to push it in heap and maintain the size of heap k 
e.g. if we are going to push and size of heap is k so we first pop out then push in heap 


following this we have time complexity become nlogk 


so as we have chosen max heap (maximum element will be at top)
at the end of array the topmost element is ans kth smallest element 





priority_queue<int> pq, //max heap max element at top 
priority_queue<int,vector<int>, greater<int> > pq


typedef pair<int,pair<int,int>> ppi
