Binary Search

ask in interview in coding too by many good companies

Problems

Binary Search
order agnostic binary search 
Ist and last occurence of an element
count of element in a sorted array
number of times array is rotated
find an elemnt in rotated sorted
searching in nearly sorted array
floor/ceil of an element
next letter
index of last 1 in sorted array 
find the positive of an elemrnt in a sorted array 
minimum difference element in a sorted array
bitonic array max elemnt
search in bitonic
search in rowwise + columnwise sorted matrix
find element in sorted array that appear only once
allocate minimum number of pages (flipkart same format question)



so whenever there is sorted there may be a chance of binary search 
binary search on answer (array is not sorted even)
