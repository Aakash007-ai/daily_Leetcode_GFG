in this we decorate an object to create a new object with additional properties
like the pizza, base pizza and adding topping to it or coffee 
so, think how can we achive this

we are passing object of same type and returning object of same type
normal pizza object we made 
now we pass that noraml pizza to another object of same type

so made an interface/abstract class which follow has a and is a relatinoship 



signature of decorator class should be same as signature of base class
so we have to inherit the base pizza too, since we wrap that in
