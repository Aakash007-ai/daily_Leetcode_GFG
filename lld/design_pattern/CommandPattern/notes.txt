purpose The command pattern turns request into object , 
which allow us to parameterize other objects with different requests, 
delay execution or support undoable operations

example : Remote Control for Devices
Imagine you have a universal remote control that can turn on/off devices like TV, stereo and lights. 
.the remote control doesn't need to know the details of how each devices works.
It only needs to send commands




















either we call it command pattern or single chain responsibility 

chain of responsibility :- it is used when we have to design atm machine, vending machine , 
when we send a request and does not know who will fulfill it
