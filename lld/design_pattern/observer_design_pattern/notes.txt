observer design pattern, or subscriber model

so here are 2 entitiels observable and observer
e.g. we have a weather station which broadcast temperature, humidity , which we called observable 
another is tv display which listen to changes and perform actions , called observer 

so when we said observer, it means we got our results here

so weather station has a list of observer rather than  a single observer , 
it has method setTemperature, which on change of temperature, it call notify method 

notify method iterate over all oberserver in list and call their update mehtod (may pass that value, or it has instance of observable)

observable will also have method like addObserver, removeObserver
