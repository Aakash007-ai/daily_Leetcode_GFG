facade design pattern , as it suggest 

we have a client facing library with fixed method, 

whatever change it happen behind the library does not affect the method parameters

e.g. we don't know what is behind the sort function, even if a new kind of sort came tomorrow we don't know 
we just change behind the scene

and client code remain unchanged
