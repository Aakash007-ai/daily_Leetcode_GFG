the visitor design pattern lets you add further operations to object without modifying their structure.
it allows you to define new operations on a set of objects by placing the operations in a separate object, called a visitor
this promotes flexibility and separation of concerns


e.g. shape visitor
imagine a drawing system with different shapes. 
You want to perform differnet operations (e.g. calculating area, drawing the shapes) on these shapes. 
instead of modifying each shape class to accomodate new operations, we use the visitor pattern
