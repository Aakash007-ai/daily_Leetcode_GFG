State pattern 
The State Pattern is a behavioural design pattern that allows an object to change its behaviour when its internal state change. 
Let's look at an example of how the State pattern can be applied by comparing the code before and after

Scenario
We have a system that represents a vending Machine with different states.
No Coin 
Has Coin
Sold out 
Depending  on the state, the behaviour of the vending machine changes (e.g. it accepts a coin , dispense a product or indicate it is sold out)
