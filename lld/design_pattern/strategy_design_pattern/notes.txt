Strategy Design Pattern

so suppose we have multiple child classes extended from parent class, parent class (abstraction class/interface)

parent class have a method , implemented by child class , some group of class have this method same implementation
 so we have to replicate this methods in some class


 so here problem is implementing same method in multiple class

 To solve this repetition we use Strategy Pattern 

 without strategy example,

 e.g. in CAR manufacturing , some cars have ( heavy engine in sports, luxury, LoadCarry vehicle and normal enginer in Commercial, Normal cars) 
 for now we call it drive strategy some cars type have common drive strategy

 to not to write this drive strategy again , we make a common and use dependency inversion to use this strategy 

 another e.g.
 in payment system , we have a process payment method 
 process payment can pay via credit card, upi or anything ,
 

contradict , what if we use if condition rather than multiple , then problem will be we have to add new strategy and have to change existing class


so we have a strategy interface and their implementation
with respective stratiegies

and there is a respective a fixed class that has a relationship with strategy 
on constructor injection we assign value

and call that interface method

in client code , client can pass any stratgy while creating processor class
