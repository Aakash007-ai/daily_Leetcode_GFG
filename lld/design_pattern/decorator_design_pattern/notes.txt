in decorator design pattern, just think of pizza and toppings

so we pass a object to a decorator and return a new class 

so initially we have a base class, and we pass that class to another decorator class
which definitely will have a has a type relationship and we override some its method 

also decorator should also have a is a relationship to which it is receiving

---------------------------
so what we require ------------------------

so decorator follow has a and is a relationship , 

so we need a base class which which folows is a relationship, with method to be overide 
so we declare an interface/abstract so here abstract class is required 



// so we notice this decorator pattern prevent class explosion , 
else we have to create multiple class with multiple permutation and addition of mulitple new classes , 
if we add a new decorator




// try with interface, why we can't use that
