Object Oriented Programming 

4 pillars of OOPS,

Encapsulation
Inheritance
Abstraction
Polymorphism

Encapsulation means capusulating/grouping the data and methods together into 1 entity
Inheritance means inheriting the property of parent to child
Abstraction means hiding complexity from user and exposing only necessary methods 
Polymorphism means a same function having different runtime, e.g. same method behave differently according to the input
