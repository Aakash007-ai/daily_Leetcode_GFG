So , we are given two vertives and we have to find quickly whether the two  are connected ?
check that figure

 Each graph consists of vertices and edges. The root vertices are in blue.


The primary use of disjoint sets is to address the connectivity between the components of a network. The “network“ here can be a computer network or a social network. For instance, we can use a disjoint set to determine if two people share a common ancestor.

Parent node: the direct parent node of a vertex. 
Root node: a node without a parent node; it can be viewed as the parent node of itself.

Disjoint set also known as union find 

here we are given as 2 nodes are conencted 
so initially we choose one of them as root and put other's parent as root
so next time we are going to add more node we first check who is their parent
//if their parent are same they are already connected 

to remove ambuiguity we make smallest node as root and other one as parent 
if parent is not index menas, it has its parent

if both have different parnet then we need to merge the 2 different node
