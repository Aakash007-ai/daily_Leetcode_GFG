Sequoia Capital just announced the "first cohort" of winners in the new AI era.

They are also watching a whole host of other companies which are beginning to emerge as leaders. 

The market they are going after in AI is at least 10x bigger than the cloud transition. 

And it's moving faster than any tech wave before it.

Unlike previous tech transitions, AI had:

• 5.6 billion people connected to the internet
• Global social platforms with billions of users
• No barriers to adoption
• Distribution rails already in place

Sequoia's analysis reveals several critical insights:

1. The application layer is where the real value accrues
 → Not just foundation models, but what's built on top

2. The first cohort of AI's killer apps has emerged (according to them):

 • ChatGPT - Conversational AI for general tasks
 • Claude - Helpful writing and reasoning assistant
 • Harvey - Legal AI for document drafting
 • Sierra - AI agent for customer support
 • Abridge - Medical conversation summarization and documentation
 • Cursor - AI-powered coding and debugging assistant
 • Glean - Workplace search across knowledge systems

3. The next wave will be agent-first companies

 → Vertical agents trained on specific workflows
 → Agents that outperform human experts

4. They say we are entering an "abundance era" where:
 • Labor becomes cheap and plentiful
 • Taste becomes the scarce asset
 • Code is just the first market to tip

For founders building in this space, Sequoia looks for:

• Real revenue, not "vibe revenue" (tire-kicking)
• Clear path to healthy gross margins
• Data flywheels tied to business metrics
• Trust from customers

The AI economy is evolving toward multi-agent systems where agents work with each other and with humans - transferring resources, making transactions, and building trust networks.

This requires solving major technical challenges:
• Persistent identity
• Seamless communication protocols
• Security and trust mechanisms

The companies that win will be those that move at "maximum velocity" right now. Because as Sequoia puts it: "Nature hates a vacuum."

My personal opinion in watching this, attending events, and talking with others is two-fold:

1. Deep industry knowledge

AI struggles with nuance. It can't understand the unwritten rules of your industry, the subtle dynamics of your market, or why certain approaches fail despite looking good on paper.

Your experience in knowing how things actually work - not just how they should work - is what transforms AI from a generic tool into a precision instrument.

2. Real-world relationships

Trust can't be automated (yet). The connections you build in person, the reputation you've earned, and the network you've cultivated are becoming your most valuable assets.

In a world where anyone can generate content or ideas, people will increasingly turn to those they know and trust.
