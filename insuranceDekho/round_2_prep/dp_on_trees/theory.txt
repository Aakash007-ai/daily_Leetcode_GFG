diameter of a binary tree vvimp 
maximum path sum from any node to any 
maximum path sum from leaf to leaf 
diameter of nary tree



diameter may not always pass through root
for each node calculate calculate max(maxHeight,left+right) 
height of left tree + height of left tree 



int solve(){
    //recursive so base condition always there

    //hypothesis
    //we get ans from left subtree + right subtree
    //and we calculate ans for that node as root 
    //it recurively goes to left and right 
    //at base condition we get at last

    //induction
