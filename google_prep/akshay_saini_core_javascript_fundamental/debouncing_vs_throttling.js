    what is debouncing and throttling, 
    where these function used
    write their polyfill
*/

/*
    debouncing and throttling used for performance optimizations

    limiting the rate of excution of function call
*/

/*
    a search bar, you search word by word then api call is there

    debouncing
    only make function call only if difference between 2 function invokation if time between them is greater than a fixed delay

    throttling
    function is callable after a fixed delay, api call is callable after a certain time
