let's say we are asked to design file system

so, in file system we know a directory can have file and a directory and further in that directory a file and nested directory


a directory can have mulitple directory 
so 
Directory class {
    String directoryName;
    List<object> objectList;

    and for ls we iterate over objectList , put a check whether it is file or object

    if it is file typecast it and call for its ls method
}
