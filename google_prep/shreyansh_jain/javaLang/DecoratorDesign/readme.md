Decorator Design Patterns

we have a base object with its features/properties f1

then to add additional wrap that object that add another feature on it and so on , it goes on adding

real time usecase 
Pizza Shop 

here on a pizza we can add mushroom ,extraVeggies , margreta, toppings etc

so we can have basePizza + extraCheese + Mushroom 
apart from this we can add exxtraCheese again

second use case is coffee machine
normal coffee + milk 


base car + ac + power steering + woofers + alloy wheels 

so why we need Decorator pattern,
It prevent from class explosion

so in general if we do normally , 
we have to do permutation of these cars to make class and it become tidious to manage more class 


at that time we use Decorator pattern to avoid Class Explosion
